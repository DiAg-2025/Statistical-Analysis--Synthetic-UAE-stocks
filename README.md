# Synthetic UAE Stocks

[Dataset](https://github.com/DiAg-2025/Statistical-Analysis--Synthetic-UAE-stocks/blob/main/Synthetic_UAE_Stock_Data.csv)

This is synthetically generated data from Open AI that contains price data of a few UAE Stocks: EMIRATESNBD, DIB, EMAAR, CBD, MASQ, and DEWA. This comprehensive dataset spans from July 1, 2021, to March 30, 2025. The prices are denominated in AED and are indexed.

Objective:
1. Select three numerical variables, such as X1, X2, and X3, from the dataset. Create scatterplots to visualize the relationships between these variable pairs. For instance, generate scatterplots for X1 vs. X2, X2 vs. X3, and so on. Additionally, provide insights regarding the observed relationships between these variable pairs based on the scatterplot visualizations.
2. Calculate the covariance for the chosen pairs of numerical variables, such as Cov(X1, X2), Cov(X2, X3), and Cov(X1, X3). Then, analyze and interpret the relationships between these variables based on the computed covariance values.
3. Calculate the mean and standard deviation for the three chosen numerical variables. Afterward, provide an interpretation of the results to better understand the characteristics of these variables.
4. Formulate a statement to find a suitable bound (both an upper bound and a lower bound) by applying Chebyshev's inequality. Subsequently, give an interpretation of this result to understand the significance of the bound in terms of the variable's behavior and variability.
